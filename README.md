# rock-paper-scissors

Created a console level game of rock-paper-scissors.
Game ends in 5 rounds and case insensitive for input.
Prints the scores of player and computer and if you win, lose or it's a tie. 
Will return after I learn DOM to make it an actual game.

###
After learning the basics of DOM game is updated with buttons and a DOM element to follow the scores and update it with click. Game end when either side reaches 5 now.
